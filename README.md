**Backend Setup**
This document outlines the steps to set up the backend for the Online Assessment Platform, a Node.js application that provides a RESTful API to manage online exams, question banks, students, results, and more. The backend uses Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and JWT for user authentication.

**Prerequisites**
Node.js (v14+)
MongoDB (locally or use MongoDB Atlas for cloud hosting)

**Clone the Repository**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/somugowdasoft/online-assessment-platform-backend.git
cd backend
```

**Install Dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

**Environment Variables**
To configure the application, you need to set up environment variables. Create a .env file in the root of your backend directory with the following:


```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/assessment-platform
JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
JWT_EXPIRE=1h
```

**MONGO_URI:** Your MongoDB connection string.
**JWT_SECRET:** A secret key for JWT token generation.
**JWT_EXPIRE:** The duration for which the JWT is valid (e.g., 1 hour).

**Start the Backend Server**
To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Backend Tech Overview**
**Node.js & Express.js:** Handles API routes and business logic.
**MongoDB:** Stores user data, exam questions, and results.
**Mongoose:** Provides an ORM for MongoDB.
**JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Used for authenticating and authorizing users.
**Role-based Access Control (RBAC):** Differentiates between admin and student routes.
**Postman:** Useful for testing the API routes and for API documentation.


**API Endpoints**

**User Authentication**
**POST /api/auth/register:** Register a new user (Admin & Student).
**POST /api/auth/login:** Login for both Admin and Student.

**Question Bank Management (Admin Only)**
**GET /api/questions:** Fetch all questions.
**POST /api/questions/add:** Create a new question.
**PUT /api/questions/:id:** Update a specific question.
**DELETE /api/questions/:id:** Delete a specific question.

**Exam Management (Admin Only)**
**GET /api/exam:**** Get all exams.
**POST /api/exam/exmas:** Create a new exam.
**PUT /api/exam/exams/:id:** Update a specific exam.

**Students (Admin Only)**
**GET /api/students:** Fetch all students.
**DELETE /api/students/:id:** Delete a specific student.

**Results and Analytics**
**GET /api/result:** Get results for both admin (for all students) and individual students (based on role).
